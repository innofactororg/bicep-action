# Bicep deploy workflow

Reusable workflow to plan and deploy Azure infrastructure.

## Overview

![Deploy workflow](images/deployment-action-flow.jpg)

1. A user creates a new branch, then commits and push the code.
1. A user creates a pull request.
1. The plan job is automatically triggered.
1. If the plan job was successful, the workflow will wait for a required reviewer (if configured) to approve the deployment.
1. When a reviewer has approved, the workflow deploys the code.

## Get started

To use the workflow, several prerequisite steps are required:

1. [Create an environment](https://docs.github.com/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#creating-an-environment).

   To prevent unapproved deployments, make sure to add **"Required reviewers"**.

   Remember to save the protection rules after making changes.

1. [Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app).

1. [Assign appropriate Azure roles to the application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps).

1. Give the workflow Azure login permission:

   - **Option 1**: [Add federated credentials (recommended)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-portal%2Clinux#use-the-azure-login-action-with-openid-connect)

     - Use the scenario **"GitHub Actions deploying Azure resources"**.
     - Select entity type **"Pull request"** (needed for the [plan job](#plan-job)).
     - Save the credential.
     - Add another federated credential with the scenario **"GitHub Actions deploying Azure resources"**.
     - Select entity type **"Environment"** (needed for the [create job](#create-job)).
     - Specify the environment name that the workflow use.
     - Save the credential.

     Note that there is a limit of 20 federated credentials per application. For this reason, and for security reasons, it is recommended to create a separate application for each repository.

   - **Option 2**: [Add client secret](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app#add-a-client-secret)

     - Use this option instead of federated credentials.
     - Create a secret for the app. Remember that the secret must be replaced when it expires.
     - Specify **"AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET"** as a secret for the workflow.

### Auto merge

To allow pull requests to merge automatically once all required reviews and status checks have passed, enable **"Allow auto-merge"** in the repository settings under **"General"**.

For auto merge to work properly, [branch protection](#branch-protection) must be configured.

### Branch protection

It is recommended to protect the default branch. This is done in the repository settings under **"Branches"**.

Recommended branch protection for production use:

- Require a pull request before merging
  - Require approvals
  - Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
  - Require approval of the most recent reviewable push
- Require status checks to pass before merging
  - Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - Add the following status checks:
    - üîß Deploy / üóìÔ∏è Plan
    - üîß Deploy / üèÉ Create
- Require conversation resolution before merging
- Require linear history
- Require deployments to succeed before merging (and select the environment that must succeed)

This ensures that no changes to the pull request are possible between the approval and the merging and that a successful plan and deploy has occurred.

## Workflow

The workflow name is used to ensure that only one deploy workflow runs at any given time. If a new workflow starts with the same name, GitHub Actions will cancel any workflow already running with that name.

### Plan job

The plan job will build and test the code. If no issues are found in the code, a [what-if](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/deployment/sub#az-deployment-sub-what-if) report is generated.

The plan job use the following tools:

- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/)
  - [az login](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest#az-login)
  - [az bicep build](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/bicep?view=azure-cli-latest#az-bicep-build)
  - [az bicep build-params](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/bicep?view=azure-cli-latest#az-bicep-build-params)
  - [az deployment {SCOPE} validate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/deployment/sub?view=azure-cli-latest#az-deployment-sub-validate)
  - [az deployment {SCOPE} what-if](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/deployment/sub?view=azure-cli-latest#az-deployment-sub-what-if)
- [microsoft/ps-rule@v2](https://github.com/microsoft/ps-rule)
- [azure-cost-estimator](https://github.com/TheCloudTheory/arm-estimator)

The PSRule step will only run if the repository has a **"ps-rule.yaml"** file in the root.

For more information about PSRule configuration, see:

- [Sample ps-rule.yaml](ps-rule.yaml)
- [Configuring options](https://azure.github.io/PSRule.Rules.Azure/setup/configuring-options/)
- [Options](https://microsoft.github.io/PSRule/v2/concepts/PSRule/en-US/about_PSRule_Options/)
- [Rules by resource type](https://azure.github.io/PSRule.Rules.Azure/en/rules/resource/)

### Create job

The create job requires that the plan job was successfully completed and targets a specific [environment](#get-started). If the environment is configured with **required reviewers**, the job will require manual approval.

The create job use the following tools:

- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/)
  - [az login](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest#az-login)
  - [az provider register](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/provider?view=azure-cli-latest#az-provider-register)
  - [az deployment {SCOPE} create](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/deployment/sub?view=azure-cli-latest#az-deployment-sub-create)

### Passing secrets

If the value of **"azure_tenant_id"**, **"azure_client_id"** or **"azure_subscription_id"** is stored as a secret, it can be passed using the secrets syntax.

Note that secrets are masked in the job log. The result is that IDs can't be seen and it may be difficult to see if the wrong ID is used.

  pull_request:
