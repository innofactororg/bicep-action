# Bicep workflow

A reusable workflow to to manage Azure infrastructure with Bicep.

## Getting Started

To use the workflow, several prerequisite steps are required.

### Create GitHub Environment

The workflow utilizes GitHub Environments to enable an approval process for the deployment.

[Create an environment](https://docs.github.com/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#creating-an-environment) in the repository that use this workflow.

Add **Required reviewers** that need to sign off on deployments. Save the protection rules.

### Setup Azure Identity

A Microsoft Entra ID application is required by this workload. It must have permission to deploy the code.

Create a single application and give it the appropriate read/write permissions in Azure.

#### Use federated credentials (recommended)

[Add federated credentials](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-portal%2Clinux#use-the-azure-login-action-with-openid-connect) for the scenario **GitHub Actions deploying Azure resources** and for each repository that use this workflow.

To allow a pull request to validate and test deployments, add a credential where entity type is **Pull request**.

To allow deployments, add a credential where entity type is **Environment**. Specify the **GitHub Environment name** that is passed to the workflow, e.g. `production`.

Note that there is a limit of 20 federated credentials per application. For this reason, and for security reasons, it is recommended to create a separate application for each repository.

#### Use client secret

To use a **Client secret** instead of federated credentials, specify **AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET** as a secret for the workflow, as shown in usage below.

## Workflow

### Plan

Each time a **pull request** is created or updated, the workflow will start and validate the code. If no issues are found in the code, a [what-if](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/deployment/sub#az-deployment-sub-what-if) report is generated for easy review.

### Deploy

The workflow can be started manually (**workflow dispatch**) or automatically when a **pull request review** is submitted with an **approved** state.

This stage is set to a specific [environment](#create-github-environment). If **required reviewers** have been added, the deployment job will only run after manual approval from one of the specified approvers.

When started, the workflow will [deploy](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/deployment/sub#az-deployment-sub-create) the code to Azure.

1. Create a new branch and check in the needed code.
1. Create a Pull Request (PR) in GitHub once the changes are ready.
1. A GitHub Actions workflow will trigger to ensure the code is well formatted, internally consistent, and produces secure infrastructure. In addition, a What-If analysis will run to generate a preview of the changes that will happen in Azure.
1. Once appropriately reviewed, the PR can be merged into the main branch.
1. The changes are deployed to Azure.

## Passing secret as input

If the input value is stored as a secret, it can still be passed using the env syntax.

In the following example a secret called **AZURE_APP1_TENANT_ID** is passed to the input **azure_tenant_id** using environment variable **TENANT_ID**:

```yaml
name: Azure Deploy
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - "**.bicep"
      - "**.bicepparam"

  pull_request_review:
    types: [submitted]

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: ðŸ”§ Bootstrap
    uses: innofactororg/bicep-action/.github/workflows/bootstrap.yml@v1
    env:
      TENANT_ID: ${{ secrets.AZURE_APP1_TENANT_ID }}
    with:
      environment: sandbox1
      azure_tenant_id: ${{ env.TENANT_ID }}
      azure_client_id: 6a31b6a2-4558-43bb-896a-008e763058bd
      azure_subscription_id: aeac59a3-67af-474b-ac4a-67ee18414df1
      location: westeurope
      scope: sub

      parameters: main.bicepparam
      log_severity: INFO
```
