# Bicep deploy

This repository includes GitHub actions and Azure DevOps [pipeline](.azuredevops/README.md) to plan and deploy Azure infrastructure.

## Overview

![Flow overview](images/deploy-flow.drawio.png)

1. The user creates a new branch, then commits and push the code.
1. The user creates a pull request.
1. The workflow is automatically triggered and starts the [plan job](#plan-job).
1. If the plan job was successful, the workflow will wait for a [required reviewer](#get-started) to approve the [deploy job](#deploy-job).
1. When a reviewer has approved, the workflow starts the [deploy job](#deploy-job) to deploy the code.

## Get started

To set up a bicep deploy workflow, several prerequisite steps are required:

1. Create an [environment](https://docs.github.com/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#creating-an-environment).

1. To prevent unapproved deployments, add **"Required reviewers"** to the environment. Remember to save the protection rules after making changes.

1. Register a [Microsoft identity platform application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app).

1. Assign [Azure roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-steps) to the application so it can deploy Azure infrastructure. For example, give it the **"Owner"** role on the target Azure subscription.

1. Give the repository Azure login permission:

   - **Option 1**: Add [federated credentials](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-portal%2Clinux#use-the-azure-login-action-with-openid-connect) (recommended)

     - Use the scenario **"GitHub Actions deploying Azure resources"**.
     - Select entity type **"Pull request"** (needed for the [plan job](#plan-job)).
     - Save the credential.
     - Add another federated credential with the scenario **"GitHub Actions deploying Azure resources"**.
     - Select entity type **"Environment"** (needed for the [deploy job](#deploy-job)).
     - Specify the environment name that was created in step 1.
     - Save the credential.

     Note that there is a limit of 20 federated credentials per application. For this reason, and for security reasons, it is recommended to create a separate application for each repository.

   - **Option 2**: Add [client secret](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app#add-a-client-secret)

     - Add the secret from the app registration as a secret in the repository. Remember that the secret must be replaced when it expires.
     - Add **"AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET"** to the workflow, see [passing secrets](#passing-secrets).

### Auto merge

To allow pull requests to merge automatically once all required reviews and status checks have passed, enable **"Allow auto-merge"** in the repository settings under **"General"**.

For auto merge to work as intended, [branch protection](#branch-protection) must be configured.

### Branch protection

It is recommended to protect the default branch. This is done in the repository settings under **"Branches"**.

Recommended branch protection for production use:

- Require a pull request before merging
  - Require approvals
  - Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
  - Require approval of the most recent reviewable push
- Require status checks to pass before merging
  - Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - Add the following status checks:
    - üèÉ Deploy
- Require conversation resolution before merging
- Require linear history
- Require deployments to succeed before merging (and select the environment that must succeed)

This ensures that no changes to the pull request are possible between the approval and the merging and that a successful plan and deploy has occurred.

## Workflow

The workflow is designed to run when a pull request is created or updated.

It has been tested on a [standard GitHub-hosted runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#standard-github-hosted-runners-for-public-repositories) with workflow label **"ubuntu-22.04"**.

The concurrency setting is configured to ensure that only one workflow runs at any given time. If a new workflow starts with the same name, GitHub Actions will cancel any workflow already running with that name.

The following tools are used:

- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/)
  - [az login](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest#az-login)
  - [az bicep build](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/bicep?view=azure-cli-latest#az-bicep-build)
  - [az bicep build-params](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/bicep?view=azure-cli-latest#az-bicep-build-params)
  - [az provider register](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/provider?view=azure-cli-latest#az-provider-register)
  - [az deployment {SCOPE} create](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/deployment/sub?view=azure-cli-latest#az-deployment-sub-create)

### Plan job

The plan job will build and test the code. If no issues are found in the code, a [what-if](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/deployment/sub#az-deployment-sub-what-if) report is generated.

The PSRule steps will only run if **"rule_option"** is specified and points to a file that exist.

For more information about PSRule configuration, see:

- [Sample ps-rule.yaml](ps-rule.yaml)
- [Configuring options](https://azure.github.io/PSRule.Rules.Azure/setup/configuring-options/)
- [Configuring rule defaults](https://azure.github.io/PSRule.Rules.Azure/setup/configuring-rules/)
- [Available Options](https://microsoft.github.io/PSRule/v2/concepts/PSRule/en-US/about_PSRule_Options/)
- [Available Rules by resource type](https://azure.github.io/PSRule.Rules.Azure/en/rules/resource/)

### Deploy job

The deploy job will only run when the plan job was successful.

A specific [environment](#get-started) must be specified for this job.

If the environment is configured with **required reviewers**, the job will require manual approval.

### Passing secrets

The input **"azure_client_secret"** is needed if federated credentials are not used. This value should be passed as a secret.

It could make sense to pass **"azure_client_id"**, **"azure_subscription_id"** and **"azure_tenant_id"** as secret too. However, note that secrets are masked in the job log. The result is that IDs can't be seen and it may be difficult to see if the wrong ID is used.

Secrets are passed using the secrets syntax, for example:

```yaml
with:
  azure_client_id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
  azure_client_secret: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET }}
  azure_subscription_id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
  azure_tenant_id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
```
