# Bicep workflow

[![GitHub Super-Linter](https://github.com/innofactororg/bicep-action/actions/workflows/linter.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter)

A reusable workflow to to manage Azure infrastructure with Bicep.

## Getting Started

To use the workflow, several prerequisite steps are required.

1. **Create GitHub Environment**

   The workflow utilizes GitHub Environments to enable an approval process for the deployment.

   [Create an environment](https://docs.github.com/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#creating-an-environment) in the repository that use this workflow.

   Add **Required reviewers** that need to sign off on deployments. Save the protection rules.

   Limit the environment to the **main** branch.

1. **Setup Azure Identity**

   A Microsoft Entra ID application is required by this workload. It must have permission to deploy the code.

   Create a single application and give it the appropriate read/write permissions in Azure.

   [Add federated credentials](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-portal%2Clinux#use-the-azure-login-action-with-openid-connect) for the scenario **GitHub Actions deploying Azure resources**.

   Add one credential for each of the following entity types:

   - **Branch**, specify GitHub branch name, e.g. `main`.
   - **Environment**, specify GitHub Environment name, e.g. `production`.
   - **Pull Request**.

Target each credential to the repository that use this workflow.

## Workflow

Each time a pull request is created or updated, the workflow will produce a [what-if](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/deployment/sub#az-deployment-sub-what-if) report and attach it to the pull request for easy review.

Each time a pull request review is submitted, the workflow will check if it is approved, and if so, the workflow will [deploy](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/deployment/sub#az-deployment-sub-create) the code to Azure.

1. Create a new branch and check in the needed code.
1. Create a Pull Request (PR) in GitHub once the changes are ready.
1. A GitHub Actions workflow will trigger to ensure the code is well formatted, internally consistent, and produces secure infrastructure. In addition, a What-If analysis will run to generate a preview of the changes that will happen in Azure.
1. Once appropriately reviewed, the PR can be merged into the main branch.
1. The changes are deployed to Azure.
